# Lava-Escape-Game
Lava Escape : Processing 3.5.4 : Java

I made Lava Escape for my game design class, I did the coding and they did most of the level creation and sprite creation. This was a lot of fun to make and I purposely wanted to make it in processing to challenge myself because of how little you’re given starting off. The idea of starting from the ground up with just the ability to make squares and color them is very appealing to me, and I really enjoyed the challenge.

The game follows the protagonist who is a temple explorer who trips a trap and needs to escape the temple with his riches (he can never escape, it’s endless)

Lava Escape uses physics and collisions with the platforms, enemies and lava to help the player navigate the temple. The world is randomly generated in a level based system, in which levels are separated by platforms similar to the one-way platforms in Mario that you can jump up through but not fall down from. The movement of the player in the y direction (up and down) is done by having all of the platforms, enemies, and other entities move down when the player jumps, meaning the player never actually moves up or down which is cool to think about. There are 6 entities; the spike, bat, wasp, spider, lava stopping potion(red), and the invincibility potion(blue). I worked to make changes/additions to sprites, entities, and levels as easy as possible, and I believe I’ve succeeded in doing that. 

This project was a lot of fun, and I thank my group mates for making the sprites and a lot of levels for the game!

Feel free to dm me any questions you have!

CONTROLS are in the program code, running from java processing you should be able to see them all
